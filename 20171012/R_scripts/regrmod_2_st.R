# Estimate the linear model "all" in which Fertility
# is the variable dependent on all the others. 

all <- ---

# Look at the summary of the linear model all.
  

# What is the interpretation of the coefficient estimates?
# Explain for each independent variable



# Now generate the summary of another linear model 
# in which Fertility depends only on agriculture.



# Do you see an interesting point when you compare the ast model to the all model?



# Let's consider the relationship between some of the factors. 
# How would you expect Education level and performance on an Examination to be related?
# Check your intuition by computing the correlation between 
# Examination and Education.


# Now find the correlation between Agriculture and Education.


# The negative correlation between Agriculture and Education might be
# affecting Agriculture's influence on Fertility.
