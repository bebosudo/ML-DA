# Residuals
# Checking the main assumptions on residuals
# A preview of diagnostic plots

fit <- lm(child ~ parent, galton)

summary(fit)

# check the mean of residuals



# check the correlation between the residuals and the predictors


# Question
# variance of residuals
# 
# 1: is less than the variance of data
# 2: is greater than the variance of data
# 3: is unknown without actual data


# The two properties of the residuals we've emphasized here can be applied to datasets which have multiple predictors. 
# Load the dataset attenu which gives data for 23 earthquakes in California. Accelerations are estimated based on two predictors, distance and magnitude.
# Fit the model and check the main two assumptions on residuals.
